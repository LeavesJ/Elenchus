# Retnovation — DEVLOG

## 2026-06-22 — Repo init
- Created the **separate** Retnovation git repo at `~/Documents/Retnovation` (Python, src
  layout, branch `main`). The home dir is an inert git repo (0 tracked files, no remote);
  Retnovation is its own nested repo, and the confidential design docs are gitignored and
  untracked anywhere.
- Ported lean session hygiene from Veldra: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Felix protocol, module
  boundaries, doctrine-as-data, commit rules), `docs/lessons.md` (checklists + seeded
  principles L-1..L-6), this DEVLOG.
- Approved stack decisions: Python + SQLite (runtime state/ledger/queue); curated maps +
  curator rubrics as versioned YAML in `content/`; lean hygiene.
- Read doctrine source: Berkeley Operating Guidebook §5 (retention: reversible decay, not
  erasure) and §6 (innovation bridge: the ledger of owned, unlabeled problems).
- Committed the approved harness design as a spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-22-harness-skeleton-design.md`).
- Produced the Step-1 implementation plan via writing-plans: 13 right-sized TDD tasks
  (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-22-harness-skeleton.md`), self-reviewed for spec
  coverage, placeholders, and type consistency.
- Next: isolate an execution worktree (using-git-worktrees) and execute Step 1 task-by-task
  under TDD; adversarial review on the core path (judgment loop, orchestration) before done.

## 2026-06-22 — Task 1: Types & enums (TDD PASS)
- Wrote the full `src/retnovation/types.py` module: 6 str Enums, 13 BaseModel classes, 1 dataclass; all match the brief specification exactly.

## 2026-06-22 — Task 2: Content loader (TDD PASS)
- Wrote `src/retnovation/content_loader.py` (load_map, load_rubric, load_experience_meta) with YAML maps and rubrics in `content/`. All 3 tests pass; ruff clean.

## 2026-06-22 — Task 3: Persistence (SQLite Store) (TDD PASS)
- Wrote `src/retnovation/persistence.py` (Store class: load_state, save_state, decay_frame, ledger I/O, queue FIFO); decay_frame enforces no-delete invariant (UPDATE only). All 3 tests pass; ruff clean.
